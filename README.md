# How To Get News Using Rest API?
> I provided two routes to get the result from the program

+ "http://[ADDRESS]:[PORT]/rest/api/rN/": This is the default route to get the notes, by default, it will return all of them.
+ "http://[ADDRESS]:[PORT]/rest/api/rN/:type": This api has a custom parameter "type", you can specify which release channel you wanna fetch.
